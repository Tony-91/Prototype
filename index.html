    <h2>About Taniti</h2>
    <p>
        Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than
        500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes beaches, a harbor, tropical rainforests,
        and a mountainous interior with an active volcano. The population is about 20,000, and the
        economy was traditionally fishing and agriculture until tourism boomed.
